# Weekly Reports

## Week One

Not a lot to say.  
OpenGL is really interesting. Although, it feels like We're all getting caught up on the basics, like adding libraries. I'm looking forward to getting past this initial hump, then we can start to make some interesting and fun stuff.  
A bit apprehensive about the ethics and professionalism module. I know some are fascinated by it, but to me it is just a distraction from writing code. I understand it is necessary, but in my opinion, especially in the real world, if everyone acts like adults and understands that we are all different, then there is never a problem. It is hard to quantify common sense. Perhaps I will look further into the law behind these topics. I would imagine it is well documented.  
The VR module is off to a good start too. The chance to revisit HTML is welcome, I see it as a necessary skill to have as a compiuting professional, and I don't know it well yet. As to the project, I am quite keen to revisit the [surfing game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l656n4xSNfo) that I started years ago. It feels a little cheap to not think of a new idea, but it's a good idea that tackles much of the limitations of VR, and fits with, what I see, as the gimmick that VR inevitably becomes.  
Whatever comes of these modules, I am very keen to make use of the year's developer licenses that I have for Google Play and the AppStore. Taking the VR surfing to a Google Cardboard device, or an extremely lightweight OpenGL Cannon Fodder style game (with PGC and/or online multiplayer), is extremely possible.

## Week Two

Aside from university commitments, my job is back to normal and starting to take its toll. It seems that if I am not at Falmouth, I am at work. Last year was similar in magnitude, so I am not afraid of burning myself out. But I look forward to getting used to this routine again, and not feeling as tired as I have been this week.  
The group project has started in earnest this week. The small mechanics that I have been making do not feel like much, but have been recieved reassuringly well. I look forward to getting past this basic level towards something a little more stimulating. Reflecting on last year's project, a lot of the time was spent learning Unreal Engine, and much of the satisfaction found in the challenge that posed. This year however, being much more comfortable with the tools, I must seek out new challenges, rather than become complacently competent at the level I am.  
The OpenGl module remains the most stimulating. But, I am making the effort not to try and move ahead. Self learning at this level takes great effort sifting through many poor tutorials and banging my head against unexplained concepts, only to then have Brian's lecture and live coding video explain it all succinctly and concisely. I know I really should just wait until his lecture. Although, depending on my mood, head banging can be preferable to HTML or ethics research.  
Finishing on a small note, reflecting on last year, the ToDo.txt is back! Ordering my work to do, in terms of size and urgency, with a footnote of every due date listed chronologically, helps to structure my mind and prioritise my tasks. Such a simple document on my desktop saves the initial whattodotoday procrastination, and gives a feeling of control over the work beginning to loom in the near future. 

## Week Three

As pressure piles up about the impending prototype pitches for the group project, we are reminded of the different weightings of importance and other module work across the team's different routes.  The BA team members are relying on the BScs to supply the game mechanics, and finding difficulty in moving forward along their own paths until these are in place.  Fair enough.  After discussion though, it seems the BSc current workload exceeds the other paths.  With these other pressing modules, it seems a matter of team loyalty driving me to work on the group project currently.  Again, fair enough.  This isn't a complaint, more an observation.  Reading eighty ish research papers for two research journals, and one essay, can indeed wait.  


## Week Four

Despite often having covered much of the content in class, Brian's OpenGl live coding videos provide some insight into the methodology of setting out a project. I am comfortable enough now plotting and rendering 3D environments that I look forward to the next steps - loading a texture, and dealing with colliders. Then I plan on trying to actually make a Doom style game, although other modules work stops me from doing so at the moment.  
The HTML task has become a little drole now. Whilst I believe in principal it is essential to know as a computing professional, in practice it is hard to get very passionate about. Perhaps after many small chunks, I will have built up my own generic style sheet that I can understand and take forward, but not have to deal much with again.  
Due to work / other modules, I have not given any more thought to the essay or research journals yet. Hopefully this is just me being pragmatic with priorities, but after remembering last year leaving many too late, I must make an effort on starting these after the current tasks.  

## Week Five

As our summer project Battle Screens continues to slowly sell 0 - 2 most days, I have been using it as a launching off point to start talking to the guest speakers about when they finish their talk and are packing down.  Unluckily, I had to leave before the I had a chance to talk to the last speaker, so instead I emailed him.  He emailed me back almost straight away, answering all my questions, but it felt great to have actually reached out and made contact with a currently active game making professional.  This is how you get a good job at the end of this course.  I was introduced to a guy fairly high up in antimatter this week too.  After that initial contact, it doesn't now feel rude to reach out to him with some questions.  
Arguably, the staff at the university will have equal or greater advice to give, but it's this network of industry contacts out there hiring and firing, that I want to become known in.

## Week Six

The 'week of due dates' is nearing, but this time, I am prepared. Remembering how last year I would leave the work until last minute has spurred me to get on with it all a little sooner! This feeling of preparedness is far better obviously.

## Week Seven

Essay, research journal, wiki, maths library, documentation, group project. In that order. Priorities relating to hand in dates have placed the group project at the bottom of the list. I think the rest of the group understand this temporary lapse, as long as I can keep them upto date, and be honest - not promising work that I simply cannot do at the moment.

## Week Eight

Done, that was hard. Many deadlines coinciding do not leave much time for other projects. This has been brought up not only for my future's sake, but also for other students in the future.



# Key points

### Job balance

Due to living and working quite a distance away, A lot of my time is spent either working or travelling.  
roughly:  
5 * 1h 40m driving  		8h 20m  
5 * 30m walking from carpark	2h 30m  
4 * 7h job			28h  
				---
				~40hrs

### Using not learning

In the first year, the majority of the time was spent learning how to use the tools. Now, we know them, The second year seems to be about using them effectively.

### Letting the team down  

It's hard to be relied upon as a programmer, when...

### Dissertation or group???

Need to look into this thing ...

Acive vs passive voice writing style for report. Do Active!
S.M.A.R.T.

Specific	what who where when why, how achieved? Measurable outcome. How much, 
	I will improve my ... and create a new ... each week (typing speed!)
Measurable	how many
Achievable	Is it? Don't be over ambitious
Relevant	Will I need these skills in the future?
Time-bound	time constraints, I will commit ... a week to this activity


I will improve my photoshop(be more specific though) skills so that I can produce better assets for the team, which 
will improve the overall look and feel of the apps we create. I will do this by completeing a 12-week beginner's 
photoshop (be specific - name one) course on Linda.com in my owntime and creating a new app design concept each week.
I will commit three hours each week for this activity.

SMART objectives...  
Pluralsight. Unix Lamp etc. future prospects
Another app... AR? iOS License. folio Don't slow down momentum?
typing speed, for notes during lectures. I find I learn more effectively, by following the teachers line of thoughte.g. Live coding videos
Outreaching, Email guest speakers I would find it hard to number specific goals? networking
Read research?
Pick specialist subject asap then ^ then consider dissertation.
Would love to get something published? Prob not achievable.


Recently the University gave the opportunity to take the Unity Certification exam, and I did not even briefly consider applying. In my opinion, a portfolio piece made using Unity would be far more valuable than the cretificate offered. This is all very well, however to follow this thought I must follow through and develop a portfolio piece using Unity now 

Would love to get something published

Another app... AR? iOS License. folio Don't slow down momentum?
