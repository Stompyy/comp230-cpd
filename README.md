# Weekly Reports

## Week One

Not a lot to say.
OpenGL is really interesting. Although, it feels like We're all getting caught up on the basics, like adding libraries. I'm looking forward to getting past this initial hump, then we can start to make some interesting and fun stuff.
A bit apprehensive about the ethics and professionalism module. I know some are fascinated by it, but to me it is just a distraction from writing code. I understand it is necessary, but in my opinion, especially in the real world, if everyone acts like adults and understands that we are all different, then there is never a problem. It is hard to quantify common sense. Perhaps I will look further into the law behind these topics. I would imagine it is well documented.  
The VR module is off to a good start too. The chance to revisit HTML is welcome, I see it as a necessary skill to have as a compiuting professional, and I don't know it well yet. As to the project, I am quite keen to revisit the [surfing game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l656n4xSNfo) that I started years ago. It feels a little cheap to not think of a new idea, but it's a good idea that tackles much of the limitations of VR, and fits with, what I see, as the gimmick that VR inevitably becomes.
Whatever comes of these modules, I am very keen to make use of the year's developer licenses that I have for Google Play and the AppStore. Taking the VR surfing to a Google Cardboard device, or an extremely lightweight OpenGL Cannon Fodder style game (with PGC and/or online multiplayer), is extremely possible.
