# Weekly Reports

## Week One

Not a lot to say.  
OpenGL is really interesting. Although, it feels like We're all getting caught up on the basics, like adding libraries. I'm looking forward to getting past this initial hump, then we can start to make some interesting and fun stuff.  
A bit apprehensive about the ethics and professionalism module. I know some are fascinated by it, but to me it is just a distraction from writing code. I understand it is necessary, but in my opinion, especially in the real world, if everyone acts like adults and understands that we are all different, then there is never a problem. It is hard to quantify common sense. Perhaps I will look further into the law behind these topics. I would imagine it is well documented.  
The VR module is off to a good start too. The chance to revisit HTML is welcome, I see it as a necessary skill to have as a compiuting professional, and I don't know it well yet. As to the project, I am quite keen to revisit the [surfing game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l656n4xSNfo) that I started years ago. It feels a little cheap to not think of a new idea, but it's a good idea that tackles much of the limitations of VR, and fits with, what I see, as the gimmick that VR inevitably becomes.  
Whatever comes of these modules, I am very keen to make use of the year's developer licenses that I have for Google Play and the AppStore. Taking the VR surfing to a Google Cardboard device, or an extremely lightweight OpenGL Cannon Fodder style game (with PGC and/or online multiplayer), is extremely possible.

## Week Two

Aside from university commitments, my job is back to normal and starting to take its toll. It seems that if I am not at Falmouth, I am at work. Last year was similar in magnitude, so I am not afraid of burning myself out. But I look forward to getting used to this routine again, and not feeling as tired as I have been this week. 
The group project has started in earnest this week. The small mechanics that I have been making do not feel like much, but have been recieved reassuringly well. I look forward to getting past this basic level towards something a little more stimulating. Reflecting on last year's project, a lot of the time was spent learning Unreal Engine, and much of the satisfaction found in the challenge that posed. This year however, being much more comfortable with the tools, I must seek out new challenges, rather than become complacently competent at the level I am. 
The OpenGl module remains the most stimulating. But, I am making the effort not to try and move ahead. Self learning at this level takes great effort sifting through many poor tutorials and banging my head against unexplained concepts, only to then have Brian's lecture and live coding video explain it all succinctly and concisely. I know I really should just wait until his lecture. Although, depending on my mood, head banging can be preferable to HTML or ethics research. 
Finishing on a small note, reflecting on last year, the ToDo.txt is back! Ordering my work to do, in terms of size and urgency, with a footnote of every due date listed chronologically, helps to structure my mind and prioritise my tasks. Such a simple document on my desktop saves the initial whattodotoday procrastination, and gives a feeling of control over the work beginning to loom in the near future.
